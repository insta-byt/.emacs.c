PACKAGE is a symbol or list of them. These are package names, not modes,
functions or variables. It can be:
- An unquoted package symbol (the name of a package)
    (after! helm BODY...)
- An unquoted list of package symbols (i.e. BODY is evaluated once both magit
  and git-gutter have loaded)
    (after! (magit git-gutter) BODY...)
- An unquoted, nested list of compound package lists, using any combination of
  :or/:any and :and/:all
    (after! (:or package-a package-b ...)  BODY...)
    (after! (:and package-a package-b ...) BODY...)
    (after! (:and package-a (:or package-b package-c) ...) BODY...)
  Without :or/:any/:and/:all, :and/:all are implied.
This is a wrapper around `eval-after-load' that:
1. Suppresses warnings for disabled packages at compile-time
2. No-ops for package that are disabled by the user (via `package!')
3. Supports compound package statements (see below)
4. Prevents eager expansion pulling in autoloaded macros all at once"
